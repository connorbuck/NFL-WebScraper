# NFL Webscraper

## Overview
* This project allows the user to grab the game results for any week of any NFL season between the years 1970-2020.
* These game results are displayed in a simple GUI application with small design features used to display these results in a clean, easy-to-read format.

## Purpose
* I created this project to learn basics of web scraping and python application development.
* I am a huge fan of the NFL and felt that this project combined my interests of programming and football.

## Notes
* All NFL data used in this project can be found here: **https://www.pro-football-reference.com/**
* Due to the structure of the website above, the game results shown do not reflect which team was the home-team or away-team
  * The second team listed in each game result is the winning team (except for games which ended in a tie)
* This project uses **Python 3.7.6** as well as other packages which can be found in the **'requirements.txt'** file
